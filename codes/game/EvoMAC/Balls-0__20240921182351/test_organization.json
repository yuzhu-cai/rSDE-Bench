Verify the logging order, ensuring basic operations are logged first, followed by subsequent events. Check the data format, keys, and values for accuracy, paying attention to nested data types and each element.",
        "Programmer 2": "Test the logging mechanism for special triggered conditions, such as when the player's ball consumes an enemy ball or when the game ends due to the player's ball being consumed. Ensure that these events are logged correctly and that the log entries reflect the appropriate game state.",
        "Programmer 3": "Test the value initialization required by the task to ensure they are correctly achieved. Pay attention to the coordinates of the player's ball and enemy balls, ensuring they are initialized in the correct positions relative to the game interface.",
        "Programmer 4": "Test the function inputs and the global variables imported in each function. Ensure that the input values and global variables used in the functions are valid and involved when the function is called.",
        "Programmer 5": "Test each event in the task to ensure it is implemented correctly and that the logic triggered matches the conditions described in the task. This includes player movement, ball consumption, and spawning of new balls."
