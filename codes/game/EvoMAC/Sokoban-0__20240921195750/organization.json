        "Programmer 1": "Fix the movement logic in the `move_player` function to ensure that the player's position is only updated when a valid move is made. This includes checking if a box can be pushed and ensuring that the player cannot move into walls or other boxes. Update the logging mechanism to only log valid moves and the correct game state.",
        "Programmer 2": "Update the `log_event` function to ensure that it accurately reflects the game state after each action. Ensure that the log captures the correct player position and box positions after valid moves and when the game is complete. Improve the timestamp format to be more human-readable.",
        "Programmer 3": "Implement a victory condition check that updates the game status to \"COMPLETE\" when all boxes are on their goal positions. Ensure that this check is performed after every valid move and that the corresponding log entry is created.",
        "Programmer 4": "Create a test file `test_requirement_4.py` to validate the function inputs and global variables used in the `move_player` function. Ensure that the function is correctly accessing and modifying the global variables as expected.",
        "Programmer 5": "Create a test file `test_requirement_1.py` to validate the initial positions of the player, boxes, goals, and walls to ensure they are set correctly according to the task requirements."
