This includes modifying the log_event function to correctly reference the global variables and ensuring that the values are set appropriately before logging.",
        "Programmer 2": "Update the move_obstacles function to ensure that the global variable game_over is correctly referenced and updated upon collision with fatal obstacles. This will ensure that the game correctly registers when it is over.",
        "Programmer 3": "Modify the main function to ensure that the car's speed and position are updated correctly before logging events. This will help maintain the correct state of the game during logging and ensure that the log entries reflect the actual game state.",
        "Programmer 4": "Implement unit tests for the logging mechanism to verify that the correct values are logged after each action, including special cases like collisions with obstacles."
